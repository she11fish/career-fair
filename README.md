# Inspiration
Our inspiration comes from our desire to connect with others to learn more about our interests, build a stable future and to give everyone access to equal opportunities.

# What it does
Careerly is a game that simulates a virtual job fair, allowing students to chat with professionals and real life mentors to learn more about different fields of interest and explore different careers. By making career exploration fun and accessible, Careerly is the best resource for students to plan their careers. Careerly also helps eliminate the underrepresentation of black people by demonstrating black excellence in important roles in our society such as doctors, pilots, and artists.

# How we built it
We constructed the scene of a virtual job fair using Unity, where we gave life to the many different mentors and professionals by integrating Cohere's Artificial Intelligence API into our game. We also uploaded our game to a visually appealing website that allows the user to input information which will be helpful to their experience interacting with professionals and mentors in Careerly.

# Challenges we ran into
We had trouble configuring Cohere's AI to give accurate, consistent, and humanlike responses. Another challenge we ran into was Integrating Cohere's API into our game and establishing communication between the two.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
Having given us quite a run for our time, we were more than pleased when Cohere's AI was behaving the way we intended it to. We are also proud of having configured a solid and secure end-to-end connection. We are most proud of the way we combined our wide variety of skillsets to work together in a way that fostered exponential productivity, allowing us to create the stellar project that is Careerly.

# What we learned
We all took away some new skills from building this project, be it learning new frameworks from scratch such as UI design in Unity, communicating with APIs, gaining a solid grasp on routing and WebGLs or developing a game in first person perspective.

# What's next for Careerly
We plan on expanding the job fair by adding a larger variety of career paths to give the user a broader range of information and opportunities to find out what really interests them. We also plan to get in touch with real mentors and make the process of matching users up with mentors more tailored to their individual interests!
